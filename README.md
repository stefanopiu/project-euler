# Project Euler

[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) is a very interesting website which provides math problems solvable through simple computer programs. I decided to try to solve as many of these problems as a way to learn new concepts and familiarise with Python at the same time.

This repository will contain a collection of the codes I used to solve the problems. The programs are written for use with Python 3.6.1.

**Solved:** 1 of 609
